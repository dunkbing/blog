The `net/http` Package in Go
============================

The `net/http` package in Go is a powerful tool for building HTTP servers and clients. It provides a rich set of functionalities for handling HTTP requests and responses, making it a versatile package for a wide range of web-related tasks.

Setting Up a Simple HTTP Server
-------------------------------

Let's delve into a simple example of how to set up an HTTP server using the `net/http` package.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

This program sets up a server that listens on port 8080 and responds with "Hello, World!" for any request to the root ("/") path.

Handling HTTP Requests
----------------------

```go
http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
})
```

The `http.HandleFunc` function is used to define how the server responds to specific routes. The provided function takes two parameters: `http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request`. The response writer is used to send the response back to the client, and the request contains information about the incoming request.

Starting the Server
-------------------

```go
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

This line starts the HTTP server. It listens on port 8080, and the `nil` argument means that it will use the default ServeMux (multiplexer) provided by the `http` package. The server will handle incoming HTTP requests based on the registered handlers.

Working with Query Parameters
-----------------------------

You can easily handle query parameters using the `r.URL.Query()` method. Let's modify our server to greet a user based on a provided name parameter:

```go
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
        if name == "" {
            name = "Guest"
        }
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", name)
    })

    // ... rest of the code
}
```

Now, you can visit `http://localhost:8080/?name=John` and the server will respond with "Hello, John!"

Serving Static Files
--------------------

```go
staticDir := http.Dir("./static")
fileServer := http.FileServer(staticDir)
http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fileServer))
```

Create a 'static' folder alongside your `main.go` file and add any static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, you created `hello.html` inside the 'static' folder.

Now, when you visit `http://localhost:8080/static/hello.html`, you will be able to see your HTML served.

**Explanation:**

The `http.Dir` function is used to convert a string (representing a directory path) into a type that implements the `http.FileSystem` interface.

The `http.FileServer` function is used to serve static files in the directory.

The `http.StripPrefix` function is used to remove the "/static/" prefix from the request URL before passing it to the file server. This is useful to avoid exposing the actual directory structure in the URL.
