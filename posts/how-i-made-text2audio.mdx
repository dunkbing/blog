In this post, I'll walk you through the creation of my website [Text2Audio](https://text2audio.cc) using FreshJS, a full-stack Deno framework. The site leverages the Google Text-to-Speech API (actually Google Translate API) and is deployed on Deno Deploy. You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/dunkbing/text2audio).

### What is Text2Audio.cc?

Text2audio.cc is a straightforward platform allowing you to convert any text into audio via Google's text-to-speech service. It supports multiple languages, voices, and speeds, with the option to download the resulting audio as an mp3. Additionally, you can paste a URL, and the website automatically extracts the text from the webpage, converting it into audio.

### Why did I create Text2Audio.cc?

This project was a personal endeavor to delve into Deno, FreshJS, and the Google Text-to-Speech API. I also aimed to craft a practical tool for generating audio for my TikTok videos.

### How was Text2Audio.cc developed?

The tools and technologies used include:

- **Deno**: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript with features such as built-in TypeScript support, a dependency manager, and a rich standard library.

- **FreshJS**: A Deno web framework resembling Next.js, supporting TypeScript out of the box, server-side rendering, island architecture, and API routes.

- **Google Text-to-Speech API**: A service within the Google Translate API, converting text into natural-sounding speech with diverse language and voice options.

- **Deno Deploy**: A global deployment platform for Deno applications, offering low-latency execution on the network edge.

- **Cloudflare R2**: Used for storing and serving audio files, it's an S3-compatible storage service with 10GB of free storage.

### The key steps in creating Text2Audio.cc were:

1. Generate a FreshJS project using the `deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev` command.
2. Utilize the project's pre-configured dependencies.
3. Set up the home page in the `index.tsx` file with Preact components for the website's UI and user interactions.
4. Develop an API route in the `audio.ts` file for converting text to audio using the Google Text-to-Speech API.
5. Create a utility function in the `utils` folder to fetch text from a URL.
6. Test the website locally with `deno task start` for a development server with hot reloading.
7. Deploy the website to Deno Deploy by pushing the project to GitHub and connecting it to Deno Deploy.

And there you have it! That's the journey from conceptualization to deployment of my website, [Text2Audio](https://text2audio.cc), built on FreshJS, utilizing the Google Text-to-Speech API, and deployed on Deno Deploy.
