A singly linked list is a dynamically distributed collection of Nodes, arranged in such a way that each Node contains a value (Data) and a pointer (Next). The pointer will point to the next element of that linked list. If the pointer points to NULL, it is the last element of the linked list.

|Content|Array|Linked List|
|---|---|---|
|Size|- Fixed size<br/> - Need to specify size during declaration|- Size changes during element addition/removal.<br/>- Maximum size depends on memory|
|Memory Allocation|Static: Memory allocated during compilation.|Dynamic: Memory allocated during run time.|
|Ordering and sorting|Stored in a contiguous array of memory cells.|Stored in random memory cells.|
|Accessing|Accessing random element directly using array index: O(1).|Accessing a random element requires traversing from the beginning/end to the element: O(n).|
|Searching|Linear search or binary search.|Only linear search is possible.|

With other languages such as Java, C#, Python, there is no pointer concept, so you can use the available library, but to understand how to install it, you can see your C++ sample code.

Implement a singly linked list. Example for C++:
Node declaration:
```jsx:linkedlist.cpp
struct Node {
	  int data;
	  Node* next;
};
```
Create a new Node:
```jsx:linkedlist.cpp
Node* createNode(int x) {
    Node* temp = new Node;
    temp->next = NULL;
    temp->data = x;
    return temp;
}
```
Add an element to the end of the listLinker knowing the pointer is pointing to the last element:
```jsx:linkedlist.cpp
Node* addElement(Node*p, int x) {
	Node* temp = createNode(x); // Create a new node with x is the value.
	p->next = temp; // Add that node to the end of the list.
	return temp; // temp now is the lst node.
}
```
Traversing through the elements in the linked list.
```jsx:linkedlist.cpp
Node* p = l;
while (p != NULL) {
    p = p->next;
}
```
