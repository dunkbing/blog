### Deno is more secure and simpler alternative to Node.js

- Deno focuses on security and restricts permissions by default
- You can easily allow permissions for specific actions

### Deno supports JavaScript and TypeScript

- You can write your code in JavaScript or TypeScript
- Deno handles TypeScript, code formatting, linting, and type checking out of the box

### Deno has a built-in Key/Value store

- Deno provides a JavaScript friendly database with a few lines of code
- It uses SQLite in custom deployments and a cloud-based store in Deno Deploy

### Deno is backwards compatible with npm packages

- You can still use npm libraries with Deno
- There is an --no-npm flag to avoid node_modules

### Installing Deno

- MacOS or Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

- Windows

```bash
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Getting started with Deno is simple

- Open a text editor and start writing Deno apps
- No need to install anything else
- For example, create a hello.ts file and write:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, Deno!');
// Run the program with `deno run hello.ts`.
// You'll see the output "Hello, Deno!"
```

## Importing packages in Deno

- Import JavaScript/TypeScript modules directly from URLs
- Use deno.land/x for packages and deno-types for npm packages
- Example

```javascript
// @deno-types="npm:@types/express@4.17.20"
import express from 'npm:express@4.18.2';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello Deno!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```
